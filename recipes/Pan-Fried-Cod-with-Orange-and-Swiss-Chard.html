            <br>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <br>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <br>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <br>
            <li>1 orange, halved and thinly sliced</li>
            <br>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish</li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li>Orange wedges, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="noun sama">Directions</h2>

        <ol class="noun pan">
            <li>Season each cod fillet on both sides with salt and pepper. Put the flour in a large bowl and stir in the cayenne pepper. Dredge each piece of cod thoroughly in the flour.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large sauté pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the cod and pan-fry until browned and fully cooked, about 3 to 4 minutes on each side.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Remove the cod from the pan and drain all but 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the onion and orange, and sauté until the onion is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley and Swiss chard, and cook until tender, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer each piece of cod to a plate and divide the onion, orange and Swiss chard mixture evenly among the plates. Garnish with more parsley and orange wedges. Serve immediately.</li>
