        <h2>Description</h2>

        <P>Hey, there’s nothing wrong with dumping jarred marinara onto your plate of pasta. It takes two minutes. But sometimes we want something a little more…elegant. That’s where this 15-minute lemony broccolini pasta comes in. It’s gorgeous enough to serve at your next dinner party, but not too fancy for the kiddos.</P>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <br>

            <br>
            <li>1 pound broccolini, roughly chopped</li>
            <br>
