        <h2>Description</h2>

        <P>Hey, there’s nothing wrong with dumping jarred marinara onto your plate of pasta. It takes two minutes. But sometimes we want something a little more…elegant. That’s where this 15-minute lemony broccolini pasta comes in. It’s gorgeous enough to serve at your next dinner party, but not too fancy for the kiddos.</P>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound casarecce or other short pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 pound broccolini, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li>½ cup pine nuts</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the instructions on the package until al dente.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the broccolini and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, lemon zest and lemon juice; sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>

            <li>Stir in the heavy cream and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the Parmesan cheese.</li>

            <li>Drain the pasta and then combine it with the sauce, tossing well to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Garnish with pine nuts and basil.</li>
